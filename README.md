ThingSpeak is an IoT analytics platform service that allows you to aggregate, visualize and analyze live data streams in the cloud. ThingSpeak provides instant visualizations of data posted by your devices to ThingSpeak. With the ability to execute MATLABÂ® code in ThingSpeak you can perform online analysis and processing of the data as it comes in.
We have designed Arduino-based devices which collect temperature and humidity by DHT11 sensor and then send it to thingspeak cloud through  ESP8266 Wi-Fi module
o Successfully implemented for IoT Workshop.
